#+TITLE: Portable Emacs

My configuration for emacs. Feel free to use. The command files are compiled into this readme.

* Installation instructions

  This will erase previous init.el, so please back-up your emacs.d
  before running this.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mkdir ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d

git clone https://github.com/acarrab/portableEmacs.git
cd portableEmacs

bash ./install.sh
   #+END_SRC

  You can still add settings to your init.el file as well.
